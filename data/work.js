 * data/work.js — "My Constellations": projects and case studies.
 *
 * Each project is a star; projects with the same `constellation` are drawn together.
 * Case-study fields (leave '' or [] where you have nothing documented — they stay hidden):
 *   context     the problem or opportunity
 *   objective   what the work set out to do
 *   role        your role / contribution
 *   approach    list: methods and steps
 *   tools       list: tools and technologies you actually used
 *   insights    list: what you found
 *   results     list: documented outcomes and deliverables (no invented numbers)
 *   images      list of { src, w, h, alt, caption } — WebP in assets/media/work/<project>/ (tools/prepare_media.py)
 *   links       list of { label, url } — live demo, repository, deck, write-up
 *   background  list of { text, sources: [{ label, url }] } — context researched from public sources
 *               (the market, the company, the method). Shown under "Background", always with its sources;
 *               never use it for claims about your own results.
 *   documents   list of { title, kind, url?, note? } — related documents. With a url the row opens it;
 *               without one it becomes an "Ask for it" email to you, for work you share on request.
 *   related     connected stars: 'w:<project>', 'j:<journey entry>', 'c:<country code>', 's:<skill>'
 * `short` = label drawn next to the star;  `star` = its position in the constellation drawing (0–1 each way);
 * `magnitude` = brightness (0.6–1).
 *
 * Featured projects (the websites) carry a few more fields:
 *   featured    true — shown in "Featured projects" at the top of the section and on the homepage
 *   status      'live' or 'in-progress' (an "In progress" badge, no live link until it is ready)
 *   tagline     one line under the title on the card
 *   tags        other constellations the work belongs to as well, e.g. ['finance', 'analytics']
 *   cover       { src, w, h } — a screenshot of the site (assets/media/work/), used on the card and the case study
 *   glyph       how its star behaves when pointed at: 'sun' (rays), 'ripple' (rings), 'orbit' (a small moon),
 *               'flow' (two electrolyte loops), 'shot' (a ball's arc into a hoop)
 *   alsoIn      list of { constellation, star } — also draw the project in another constellation, at that
 *               position, and list it there too (it keeps one case study and one number)
